# Perspectives & Shadows

**Purpose:** Master caves' unique multi-perspective system - maintain different viewpoints on the same information through multiple identities (shadows).

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of caves and voting ([What is Caves?](../getting-started/what-is-caves.md))

---

## What Are Shadows?

**Shadows (also called perspectives or pIds) are multiple identities you can create within caves. Each shadow has its own:**

- **Username:** Display name
- **Avatar:** Visual identity (generated from username)
- **Vote history:** Independent votes
- **Contributions:** Items added, caves created
- **View of the network:** Personalized graph based on their activity

Think of shadows as different "lenses" through which you view and interact with the same underlying data. **This is caves' most unique and powerful feature.**

---

## Why Multiple Perspectives?

### The Core Insight

**The same information can be valuable from different angles.** What's relevant to you as a professional researcher might not be relevant to you as a hobbyist. What seems important today might seem less so next month. Different perspectives reveal different insights.

Instead of mixing everything together or maintaining separate accounts, **caves lets you be multiple people at once** - each with their own viewpoint, vote history, and contributions.

---

## Use Cases: When to Use Multiple Shadows

### 1. Professional vs. Personal

**Scenario:** You research AI for work but also explore it as a hobby.

**Solution:**
- **Professional shadow:** Academic papers, industry reports, technical specs
- **Personal shadow:** Blog posts, YouTube tutorials, weekend project ideas

**Benefit:** Keep work and personal interests separate but see where they overlap in the Cave Map.

### 2. Different Roles

**Scenario:** You're both a teacher and a learner in your field.

**Solution:**
- **Teacher shadow:** Curated resources for students, beginner-friendly content
- **Learner shadow:** Advanced topics you're still exploring, experimental ideas

**Benefit:** Vote differently on the same content depending on which hat you're wearing.

### 3. Experimental vs. Production

**Scenario:** You want to explore new connections without disrupting your established graph.

**Solution:**
- **Production shadow:** Stable, well-vetted connections
- **Experimental shadow:** Wild hunches, controversial links, exploratory voting

**Benefit:** Experiment freely, then merge successful patterns into your main shadow.

### 4. Different Schools of Thought

**Scenario:** You're researching a controversial topic and want to track multiple viewpoints.

**Solution:**
- **Optimistic shadow:** Positive news, solutions, success stories
- **Skeptical shadow:** Critiques, counterarguments, failure analyses
- **Neutral shadow:** Factual data, raw research

**Benefit:** See the same topic through ideological lenses, understand biases.

### 5. Team Collaboration

**Scenario:** Multiple people share one caves account (not recommended, but happens).

**Solution:**
- **Shadow per team member:** Each person has their own perspective
- Track individual contributions
- See team consensus vs. individual opinions

**Benefit:** Maintain individual identity within shared workspace.

## How Perspectives Work

### Independent Vote Histories

**Each shadow votes independently.**

**Example:**
- You add an article to "climate science" as **Professional** → Yes vote from Professional
- You view the same cave as **Skeptical** → No vote from Skeptical

**Result:**
- The article shows 1 Yes, 1 No in the global count
- **When filtered by Professional:** Shows only Professional's Yes
- **When filtered by Skeptical:** Shows only Skeptical's No

### Filtering Caves by Perspective

**Any cave can be viewed through any perspective's lens.**

**How to filter:**
1. Open a cave
2. Look for perspective/pId filter options (usually near the filter bar)
3. Select a specific shadow
4. Cave updates to show only that shadow's contributions and votes

**What changes:**
- Vote counts reflect only that perspective's votes
- Contributions show only that perspective's additions
- Network graph highlights that perspective's connections
- Avatar stack shows other perspectives who contributed

**Use when:**
- You want to see "how does this cave look from [perspective's] viewpoint?"
- Tracking individual contributions in collaborative caves
- Understanding different interpretations of the same topic

## Creating & Managing Shadows

### Creating Your First Shadow

**Free users:** 3 shadows maximum
**BERF subscribers:** Unlimited shadows

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Account page** (click your avatar/username)
2. Click **"My Shadows"** tab
3. Click **"Create New Shadow"** button
4. Fill in the dialog:
   - **Shadow name/username:** Choose a meaningful name (e.g., "Professional," "Learner," "Skeptical")
   - **Type:** Person, Place, or Thing (optional categorization)
   - Description (optional)
5. Click **Create**

**Behind the scenes:**
- A new perspective ID (pId) is generated
- A username tag is created for the shadow
- The shadow is added to your account's pId list
- You're automatically switched to the new shadow

### Switching Between Shadows

**How to switch:**
- Look for the **PID selector** dropdown (usually near your avatar in the header)
- Click to open the dropdown
- Select which shadow you want to "be"
- The interface updates immediately

**What changes when you switch:**
- All your votes now come from the new shadow
- All content you add is attributed to the new shadow
- Your avatar changes to the new shadow's avatar
- Cave Map highlights shift to the new shadow's connections

**Pro tip:** Switch shadows before voting to maintain perspective separation.

### Editing Shadow Names

**Steps:**
1. Go to Account page → My Shadows tab
2. Find the shadow you want to edit
3. Click edit icon
4. Update the username
5. Save

**Note:** Vote history and contributions remain unchanged - only the display name updates.

### Deleting Shadows

**Caution:** Deleting a shadow removes its vote history and contributions. This cannot be undone.

**When to delete:**
- Shadow was created accidentally
- Experimental shadow is no longer needed
- You're consolidating perspectives

**How to delete:**
1. Account page → My Shadows tab
2. Click delete icon for the shadow
3. Confirm deletion
4. Shadow is removed permanently

## Perspectives in the Cave Map

**The Cave Map becomes far more powerful with multiple perspectives.**

### Visualizing Different Viewpoints

When you switch perspectives in the Cave Map:

**Node highlighting changes:**
- Nodes with the current perspective's contributions are highlighted
- Edge thickness reflects the current perspective's vote strength
- Clusters form around the perspective's interests

**Avatar stacks reveal contributors:**
- Each node shows avatars of perspectives who contributed
- Click avatar stacks to see who's been active
- Identify bridge perspectives (active in many caves)

**Common connections highlighting:**
- When multiple perspectives connect the same nodes, it's highlighted
- Reveals consensus vs. individual opinions
- Shows where different viewpoints agree

### Filtering the Graph

**Filter the entire network by perspective:**
1. Open Cave Map
2. Select perspective filter
3. Graph updates to show only that perspective's connections

**Use when:**
- You want to see "What does [perspective] find important?"
- Exploring how different shadows organize the same data
- Understanding individual contributions in collaborative spaces

## Advanced: Perspective Strategy

### Naming Conventions

**Clear, purposeful names help you switch quickly:**

✅ **Good names:**
- "Professional," "Personal"
- "Teacher," "Learner"
- "Optimistic," "Skeptical"
- "Project-Alpha," "Project-Beta"
- "Research-2024," "Research-2025"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "New Perspective 1," "New Perspective 2" (unclear purpose)
- Very similar names that are hard to distinguish
- Names that don't reflect the perspective's role

### Starting Fresh vs. Forking

**Starting fresh:**
- Create a new shadow with zero votes
- Build a completely independent graph
- Use when: Exploring a new domain unrelated to existing work

**"Forking" a perspective:**
- Create a new shadow, then manually replicate key votes from another
- Slight variations in voting create different graphs
- Use when: Exploring variations on an existing theme

### Perspective Composition

**Some users create shadow "systems":**

**Example 1: Research Phases**
- **Discovery:** Wild exploration, voting on anything interesting
- **Analysis:** Curated deep dives, academic sources only
- **Synthesis:** Final insights, key takeaways

**Example 2: Content Types**
- **Visual:** Images, videos, diagrams
- **Textual:** Articles, papers, notes
- **Audio:** Podcasts, lectures, music

**Example 3: Trust Levels**
- **Verified:** High-quality sources only
- **Promising:** Unverified but interesting
- **Skeptical:** Things that need investigation

## Common Questions

**Q: Can others see all my shadows?**
A: Yes, other users see your shadows as separate contributors. Each shadow has its own avatar and username visible in caves.

**Q: Can I merge two shadows?**
A: Not automatically. You'd need to manually replicate votes from one shadow to another using the new shadow.

**Q: Do shadows share fire?**
A: Fire is earned per shadow. Each shadow has its own fire balance based on its contributions. When you earn fire through consensus, it goes to the specific shadow that made the connection. This means you can earn fire on the same connection with different shadows if they both tagged it.

**Q: What happens if I hit the 3-shadow limit (free tier)?**
A: You can't create more shadows until you either (a) delete an existing shadow or (b) upgrade to BERF for unlimited shadows.

**Q: Can I see all caves from all my shadows at once?**
A: Yes - the default view shows all activity. Filtering by perspective is optional.

**Q: Should I use shadows for team members?**
A: It works, but individual accounts are better for true multi-user collaboration. Shadows are designed for one person's multiple viewpoints.

**Q: Can I transfer a shadow to someone else?**
A: No - shadows are tied to your account. For collaboration, use separate accounts.

## Perspective Best Practices

### 1. Name Shadows by Purpose
Give each shadow a clear role so you know which to use when voting.

### 2. Switch Before Voting
Remember to switch to the appropriate shadow BEFORE voting to keep perspectives clean.

### 3. Use Filtering to Understand Differences
Regularly filter caves by perspective to see how your different shadows view the same content.

### 4. Don't Over-fragment
Too many shadows can be overwhelming. Start with 2-3 and expand only if needed.

### 5. Document Shadow Intent
Add descriptions to shadows explaining their purpose (in Account page).

### 6. Experiment with Conflicting Votes
Don't be afraid to vote differently on the same item with different shadows - that's the point!

## The Philosophy of Perspectives

**Traditional knowledge management assumes one "correct" organization.** Folders, hierarchies, and tags all push toward a single canonical structure.

**Caves rejects this assumption.** The same cave can be:
- Highly relevant from one angle
- Completely irrelevant from another
- A bridge concept connecting two domains
- A dead-end rabbit hole
- All of these at once, depending on perspective

**Multiple shadows let you hold contradictory views simultaneously** without cognitive dissonance. You can be both the enthusiastic explorer and the skeptical critic. Both the teacher simplifying concepts and the learner diving deep.

**The result:** A richer, more nuanced knowledge graph that reflects the complexity of human understanding.
