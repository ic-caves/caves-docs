# The Fire System

Fire is how Caves makes connections meaningful. It's the currency you spend to connect ideas and the signal that shows which perspectives are useful in any given domain.

## The Basics

Every connection costs 1 fire. When you put "jelly" under "peanut butter," you spend 1 fire. That's it.

## Earning Fire Back

Here's where it gets interesting. When you make a connection, you're not just spending fire—you're entering a queue.

Let's say you connect jelly → peanut butter. Caves itself is always first in that queue (more on that in a moment). You're second. When the next person comes along and makes that same connection, their 1 fire goes randomly to someone ahead of them in the queue. Could be Caves. Could be you.

As more people agree with that connection, fire keeps flowing to earlier connectors—randomly distributed among everyone who's still eligible.

## The Cap

You can't earn fire forever from a single connection. Your earning potential is capped by how many places you've put that child cave.

If you've only ever put "jelly" under one thing (peanut butter), you can only earn 1 fire back from that connection. But if you've put "jelly" under peanut butter, toast, and donuts—now your cap is 3 in *each* of those caves.

That means you can potentially earn up to 3 fire back from the peanut butter cave, 3 from the toast cave, and 3 from the donuts cave. The more places you connect an idea, the more you can earn everywhere you've connected it.

This creates an incentive to explore. Don't just make the obvious connection. Ask yourself: where else does this idea belong? The system rewards people who find multiple homes for a concept.

## Caves Takes a Cut

Caves itself is always first in every queue and never hits a cap. This means some fire always flows out of the system rather than back to users.

When you're the first person to make a connection, your fire goes to Caves. When the second person comes, it's 50/50 between you and Caves. Third person? Random among you, the second person, and Caves.

This "house edge" keeps the economy sustainable and further discourages spam—you can't guarantee you'll recoup your fire even when others agree with you.

## Earned Fire

As you earn fire within a specific cave, it accumulates. You can see who has earned the most fire in any cave—a ranked list of perspectives.

High earned fire in a cave means: "This person has made connections here that others agreed with." It's a quick way to identify trusted curators within a domain. You might be a fire leader in "peanut butter" but a nobody in "quantum physics."

Like everything in Caves, this list is filterable by perspective. The leaderboard shifts depending on whose lens you're viewing through.

## Getting Fire

**Free users** have a floor of 100 fire. If you drop below 100, it refills at moonrise. You can accumulate beyond 100 through earned fire.

**Berfs (subscribers)** get 30,000 fire added every month, regardless of current balance. Power users who want to curate at scale.

There's no ceiling—if you're making great connections that resonate, your fire can grow well beyond your allocation.

## What Fire Is (and Isn't)

Fire is **not**:

- A currency you cash out
- A status symbol for its own sake
- A game to "win"

Fire **is**:

- A signal for others—helping people quickly find useful perspectives in a domain
- A spam prevention mechanism—you can't endlessly connect without thought
- An experiment—the rules may evolve as we learn what produces the best collective outcomes

## The Honest Truth

Any visible metric creates incentive to game it. That's human nature.

The bet is that the fire system is designed so that gaming it actually produces good outcomes. The best way to accumulate fire is to… make good connections that others genuinely agree with. Your cap forces you to spread out and explore. Random distribution means you can't guarantee returns.

We're trying to build an economy where selfish behavior (wanting more fire) produces collective good (a high-quality knowledge graph). It's an ongoing experiment. The system will evolve as it scales, and watching how people try to game it reveals what needs adjustment.
