# The IC and Caves Vision

## Step 1: IC Files Everywhere

IC is a new layer for the web. Just like a site has `index.html`, it could have `index.ic`—not for presentation, but for thoughts and connections.

IC files are just text. This means they can live anywhere: on your domain (DNS proves authorship), on the blockchain (cryptographic proof), on social media (your account verifies it), in a gist, on IPFS. The format travels. Verification adapts to context.

The goal: a web of thoughts and connections sitting alongside the existing web.

## Step 2: Building on IC

Once IC files are everywhere, what do we do with them?

**Search** is one application. IC enables a different kind of search—inside-out rather than outside-in. Instead of algorithms deciding what's relevant, you start from connections and expand through similar perspectives. The human index. *(More on this: [link to article])*

**Collaboration** is another. Groups can manage their own knowledge without relying on centralized platforms. Small groups, large groups, different tools for different needs.

**Browsing, filtering, visualizing**—all up for grabs. Anyone can build tools on the format.

## Why Simplicity Matters

IC files are just indexes. Indexes of thoughts. That's it.

This isn't a limitation—it's the point. Inside-out search doesn't require massive infrastructure. AI makes it even easier: "Start here, find similar perspectives." The traversal is straightforward.

Compare to HTML: JavaScript, CSS, frameworks, build tools, rendering engines. The complexity means only big teams can move the needle. The format itself creates gatekeeping.

IC's simplicity lowers the barrier. More people can build. More experiments can happen. Simplicity enables decentralization.

## AI and Knowledge Stores

As AI grows, it becomes how we find information. But what is AI searching? The open web—noisy, gamed, full of SEO and ads. Maybe not preferable.

What AI searches through becomes more and more valuable. The quality of the index matters.

IC lets groups create their own knowledge stores. People who care about a topic can curate what matters, generate their own trusted sources, and make that available—to themselves, to each other, to AI. Interoperable. Portable. Not locked in a platform.

This is the future: not one index controlled by corporations, but many indexes maintained by communities who actually care—and linked to each other through a system of trust. Not isolated silos, but a network of knowledge stores that can connect, share, and build on one another.

## Caves: One Implementation

Caves is one way to interact with IC—a file system, a visual UI, ways to filter and create connections. But it's not *the* way. It's *a* way.

Think of it like an early web browser. Proof the format works. The vision is that others build their own tools—different UIs, different philosophies, different communities.

## The Architecture

**IC** = protocol layer. The format. Lives anywhere.

**Caves** = application layer. One tool among many (hopefully).

An ecosystem, not a platform.
