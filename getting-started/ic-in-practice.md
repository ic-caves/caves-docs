# IC in Practice: Examples

## The Trump Rorschach

Take a divisive subject like Trump. Different people see completely different things:

- Trump is a fascist
- Trump is MAGA
- Trump isn't pure enough—not truly MAGA
- Trump is the greatest president the US has ever had

Same person, wildly different readings. He's a Rorschach.

IC maps these perspectives. The interpretations themselves. How many people connect Trump to fascist? How many to MAGA? How many to greatest president? The shape of collective thought on a subject.

## One Use: Opinion Leaders

Here's one way people might use IC.

Influencers, journalists, public figures already have platforms. IC gives them a way to publish their *positions*—not blog posts, just structured takes. Stripped down. "Here's where I stand on things."

The more stripped down, the more general, the more connectable. The more specific, the more niche. Someone could be *known* for their IC file—a public graph of positions.

This way of using .ic fits how we already think about the internet: individuals broadcasting their views.  

## Identity is Optional

But IC doesn’t require identity.

Current platforms make anonymity nearly impossible. Everything ties back to an account, an email, a profile. Even “anonymous” accounts accumulate identity over time.

IC flips this. Your contributions can be just connections. No name attached. The pattern of your thoughts is useful without anyone knowing who you are.

Your idiosyncratic knowledge *is* enough identity. You know specific things because of your specific combination of interests and experiences, because of the specific words you use. Nobody else has exactly that pattern. And that pattern can be useful to others—without requiring a name.

Anonymity and usefulness, together. That’s hard to achieve anywhere else right now.

But that’s still not the true power of IC.

## The Real Power: Collective Intelligence

IC isn't really about self-expression. It's also about aggregation.

The point of the Trump example isn't any one person's take. It's the *pattern* of perspectives across many people. The shape of how a subject is understood—collectively.

For example: New Year's resolutions.

You create a connection:

`New Year's Resolutions 2026 → Be kinder to people`

That phrase isn't interesting because *you* said it. It's interesting because you can see how many people in your network made the same connection. The pattern across the community. What's resonating? What are people actually committing to?

Maybe you get ideas. Maybe you see something you hadn't considered. The collective shapes what you see.

Not "here's my unique take" but "here's a shared vocabulary of thoughts that we can all contribute to and look at together."

## Cross-Domain Lenses

Here’s where it gets interesting.

The connections you make in one area become a lens for exploring completely different areas.

**Queries:**

- “People who think like me on Trump—what are their New Year’s resolutions?”
- “Dancing with the Stars fans—what do they think about Trump?”
- “Dancing with the Stars fans who vacation in Orlando—what do they think about Trump?”

You can’t make these queries anywhere right now. Political views, TV preferences, vacation habits, personal goals—they don’t live in the same system. Algorithms are domain-specific: you liked this movie, here’s another movie.

IC breaks that. Because it’s all just connections, the similarity you establish in one place can filter what you see in another. You’re slicing by *perspective* rather than by *person*. The individual disappears. The pattern remains.

Lenses work across everything. Not strictly politics. Not strictly anything. Arbitrary cross-domain exploration based on shared perspective.

## Multiple Readings of the Same Thing

A journalist reads an article and tags it for *craft*—great example of source protection.

A reader tags the same article for *content*—important climate story.

Same article. Different readings. Both valid.

Google's embedding captures one interpretation. It flattens everything into a single semantic space. It can't know you're reading for form over content.

IC preserves the actual human reading. The connection itself is data—not derived from content, but the interpretation.
