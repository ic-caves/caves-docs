# Caves Documentation

Welcome. [Caves](https://itscaves.com) is a tool for collective knowledge building at scale.

[Caves is](https://itscaves.com/c/caves%20is)... a collective intelligence tool, an experiment in working together, the human index, an MMO knowledge game, the infinite switchboard, a new way of being online... 

Basically, caves are places where we put stuff. You could think of it as a stripped down subreddit minus conversations or what you might find when you searched up a #hashtag on a social site.

> Note: Caves is very much in alpha. This is a long time personal project of mine so please be kind. Not everything always works, and when you find something [lemme know](https://discord.gg/8bW2xwv7kc).

## What Makes Caves Unique?

**Instant Creation:** A cave is just a string of text. That's it. No setup, no moderation tools, no waiting for approval. Type a thought, it's a cave. This makes collaboration frictionless—anyone can spin up a space around any idea instantly.  

**Open Format, Truly Portable:** Unlike proprietary exports, caves uses the `.ic` text file type - a human-readable, machine-parseable format designed for sharing thoughts. You can read your data as plain text, host it anywhere online, and import `.ic` files from across the internet into caves. It's interoperable, not just exportable.

**Multiple Perspectives (Shadows):** Create different identities to maintain separate viewpoints on the same information - professional vs personal, skeptical vs optimistic, or any lens you choose.

**Human-Curated, User-Controlled:** Curate content by persepctives. Create perspectives to shape what you see. Use our algorithm to find similar perespectives or filter content manually. Both human curation AND algorithmic personalization, all under your control.

**Dual Navigation Modes:** Browse caves like Reddit (feed view with consensus sorting, filtering by type/perspective) OR explore visually through network graphs. Each serves a different purpose - feed for focused reading, network for discovery.

**Fire Economy - Scarce Voting:** An experimental, community driven, non-blockchain currency making votes meaningful instead of infinite. Earn fire as you create connection across topics when others agree with your connections. This scarcity prevents spam, encourages thoughtful curation, and creates a sustainable economy where quality content earns you more voting power. Fire is the most opinionated part of caves. It's purpose is to facilitate collaboration and thoughtfulness at scale.

## Fun Bonus Features
